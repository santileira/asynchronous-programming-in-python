"""
The difference is that each of the threads is accessing the same global variable counter and incrementing it. 
Counter is not protected in any way, so it is not thread-safe.

In order to increment counter, each of the threads needs to read the current value, add one to it, and the save that value back to the variable. 
That happens in this line: counter += 1.

Because the operating system knows nothing about your code and can swap threads at any point in the execution, 
itâ€™s possible for this swap to happen after a thread has read the value but before it has had the chance to write it back. 
If the new code that is running modifies counter as well, then the first thread has a stale copy of the data and trouble will ensue.
